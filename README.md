## Description

In this project I wanted to create a site to an elder.
Since my grandparents are no longer alive, I decided to choose an old public figure that I appreciate, so I chose Magic Johnson.

## More about the website:

- In the "About Me" section, I added a link to Magic's full stats page on the official NBA site.
- In the "My Playlist" section, there are songs that does "name dropping"to Magic Johnson.
- I chose purple and yellow as the site's colors, same as Magic's main basketball team- LA Lakers.
